--------------------ADVANCED AND ROBOT PROGRAMMING SECOND ASSIGNMENT--------------------

info.txt file contains useful informations about the project.

Andrea Manera (4668710)
Lorenzo Benedetti (4679798)

Inside the .zip archive are contained five files, three shell scripts the
sources.zip archive and the text file you are reading. In the sources archive
you find 5 directories wich contain the .c file and also a .txt file with 
informations about each process.

First of all to unzip the sources archive and install the program using the command:

source ./install.sh <pathname>

It will create a folder called <pathname> inside which are located the folders that
were in sources.zip, there will also be a folder with the executables of each process.

After that run the program with the command:

./run.sh

The second assignment is collection of 4 concurrent programs, whose aim is to measure the speed
efficiency when transferring data between a producer and a consumer using different models.

The four programs are based on a specific IPC transfer primitives, namely:
1. unnamed pipe
2. named pipe
3. socket
4. shared memory with circular buffer.

Is also present another program wich is the master process useful to manage all other processes.

-------------------------COMMON SPECIFICATIONS FOR ALL THE 4 PROGRAMS------------------------

1. In the beginning, P (producer) fills an array A of random data
2. C (conscumer) has an array B of same dimension of A
3. C receives data and fills B
4. The time spent in transfer is measured and reported
5. The array dimension can be chosen by the user at any run (a maximum value of about 100
   MB is imposed).
